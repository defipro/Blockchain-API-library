##`info.blockchain.api.receive` package

The `receive2` package contains the `ReceiveV2` class that reflects the functionality documented at https://blockchain.info/api/api_receive. It allows merchants to derive addresses from their HD wallets and be notified upon payment.

Example usage:

```java

package test;
import info.blockchain.api.receive2.*;

public class App 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
    {	
    	ReceiveV2Response response = ReceiveV2.receive(
    	        "xpub661MyMwAqRbcFtXgS5sYJABqqG9YLmC4Q1Rdap9gSE8NqtwybGhePY2gZ29ESFjqJoCu1Rupje8YtGqsefD265TMg7usUDFdp6W1EGMcet8",
    			URLEncoder.encode("https://your.url.com?secret=foo", "UTF-8"),
    			"YOUR_API_CODE");
    	
    	System.out.println(String.format("The receiving address is %s. "
    			+ "The address index is %d", 
    			response.getReceivingAddress(),
    			response.getIndex()));
    }
}

```
